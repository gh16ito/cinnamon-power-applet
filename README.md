cinnamon-power-applet
=====================

Cinnamon Power Applet compatible with upower-0.99.

This code was manually "forked" from [linuxmint/Cinnamon](https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon/) due to its lack of compatibility with *upower-0.99* used by eg. Arch Linux. If you're interested in the details see the [issue report](https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon/issues/3068).

### Installation
Simply copy *power@airlog.pisz.pl* directory to *~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets*. Then you just need to add the applet to the desired panel.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/robin92/cinnamon-power-applet.git
cp -R power@airlog.pisz.pl/ ~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/
```
